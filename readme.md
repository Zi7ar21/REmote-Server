This program allows administration and server monitoring in Python, and it comes with some basic commands. To start the server, all you have to do is type the command with the arguments like the following: ```<Port (example 51000)> <Protocol (TCP or UDP)>``` To connect a client to a server use a command like the following: ```<Host (example 192.168.0.32)> <Port> <Protocol>``` If you have connection problems then check that you are using the same ports on the server side as you are on the client side. If you are on a WAN network check the NAT settings of your modem.
