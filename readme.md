#### Translated from main branch:
This program allows administration and monitoring of a server in Python.
Syntax to start a server:
```<Port (example 51000)> <Protocol (TCP or UDP)>```
Syntax to connect to a server:
```<Host (example 192.168.0.32)> <Port> <Protocol>```
If you have connection problems then verify that you are using the same port on the server as you are on the client. ~~If you are on a WAN network check the NAT settings of your router.~~ **do not use on a remote server**
